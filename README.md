How to run the program:
1. You have created the database called "Health and Fitness Club Management" in postgreSQL database.
2. In main.py, change the user and password variable to your username and password for postgreSQL in connectToDataBase() function.
3. Theoretically you don't need to use the DDL and DML file to populate the database as once connected to the database, the program will check if the table is being created or not.
4. you can now play with the program.

For other parts of the reports, please check our submission in brightspace.
